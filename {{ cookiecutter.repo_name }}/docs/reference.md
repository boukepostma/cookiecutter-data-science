# Code reference

Here all the classes and functions defined in `main.py` and the `src` module will be documented. For this to work, it is important that all functions and classes are documented with [Google Style docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html).
